  // This allows you to organize your route segments and project files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure.

  // Route groups are useful for:

  // Organizing routes into groups e.g. by site section, intent, or team.
  // Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
  // Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts
  // Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment
  // Adding a loading skeleton to specific route in a common segment
  // More on route groups https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups
  // Essentially we can have a particular layout only applied to one group
